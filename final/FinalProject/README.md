# Monster's Maze
In this maze game, you will be navigating a cavern where there might be treasure...or MONSTERS!

* `display` - Its recommended that you have a large display for your terminal, as it displays images that are somewhat large
* `controls` - Input "Left", "Right", "Forward" and "Backward" to move in respective directions in the cavern. You can type "Inventory" to open your inventory, "Quit" to quit early. You can also type "I", "Q", "R", "L", "F", "R" as shortcut ways instead of typing the full words.
